            <li>X-Men #11</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Let's start strong. Firstly, Absolute Batman fucking rocked (as it does every month). It was a fantastic end to a fantastic first arc, and I am so excited for more in the future. Scott Snyder has blown this shit right out of the fucking park and DC has a very bright future ahead with the Absolute-Verse.</p>
          <p>Lucky Devils #2 was a great continuation and I cannot wait to see where this goes. The small references to <i>Eight Billion Genies</i> were so cute, and I hope Soule and Brown never stop working together until the end of time.</p>
          <p>Magik #2 was kind of middle-of-the-road in terms of entertainment, but the writing (Allen) and art (Peralta) are not to be dismissed. I admittedly haven't read much of her aside from her first appearance and X-Men, but I think she is very well written here and Allen is doing her great justice.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Magik, her and Juggernaut's friendship is probably my favorite thing about X-Men (2024). I missed the entire Krakoan era and have only read a headful of arcs of older X-Men stuff, so meeting Cyclops' dad was kind of a shock to me, but a pleasant surprise! I'm thrilled to see where this leads and why there is such a high bounty on Scott's head.</p>
          <p>Psylocke #4 was another one that I was kinda iffy about. Seemed like a kinda nothing-burger, just setting up the finale. Still delightful, but nothing to write home about!</p>
          <p>Ghost-Spider #10, however, was a roller coaster! Just when I think I'm getting bored, it picks right back up. Who or <strong>what</strong> is King Loki? I don't know anything about her life before 616 (I just started reading <i>new</i> comics this past year), so I am eager to learn more about her past. Obviously, I've read her appearances in Spider-Verse and have seen the movies, but I missed the last run. Here's to hoping it's entertaining, and I get what I'm looking for in a Ghost-Spider ongoing.</p>
          <p>Marvel Mutts and Powerpuff Girls were bought for my girlfriend, but I always read her comics too. Powerpuff Girls was fun as always. I especially liked the art in this one. I'd already read Marvel Mutts on Unlimited, but now I have a pretty picture to hang. It was fun to read again, and I hope Emma will like it too.</p>
          <p>Speaking of having already read, Batman #610 is a reprint of the original Hush storyline which I read fairly recently. It was fun to skim and look at the ads, though!</p>
          <p>I'd not read Amazing Spider-Man #129 though, so it was a lot of fun seeing the first appearance of The Punisher. His look is so timeless, that it fits in the modern day too. If I saw a brand-new character with his design, I genuinely wouldn't think twice. I haven't read much Punisher, but I don't really think of him as gadget-heavy, so seeing him use all those gadgets was kinda fun. I was disappointed we didn't get to see his origin story or anything, but he clearly wasn't meant to be a mainstay, just a vessel for Jackal nonsense.</p>
          <p>I also started reading The Sentry (2001) in preparation for Thunderbolts and Kraven's Last Hunt, but I haven't finished them yet, so I'll talk more about them next week probably.</p>

          <h1 style=text-align:center;>Spider-Man 2 is flawed but fun</h1>
	  	    <h2 style=text-align:center;>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</h2>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/spiderman2/poster.jpg" alt="Spider-Man 2 Poster" style="float:left;margin:5px;" height="233px" width="191px">
          </div>
          <p>I played the first game when it first came out for the PS4. I loved the gameplay, the graphics, the suits, the story, everything. I was excited for <i>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</i> but had mostly moved to PC gaming by the time it came out, so I didn't get to play it until much later. When <i>Spider-Man 2</i> was announced for the PS5, I knew I had to get one. That would prove to be impossible as finances were tight, but then they announced a PC release, and I figured I'd wait it out. When it launched on PC, I picked it up immediately and played non-stop until I hit that coveted 100%.</p>
          <p>Then why the 3 stars? You loved it so much, you got 100% and spent a whopping 33.7 hours on it. Great question! I loved the first 90% of the story, I loved most of the suits, the gameplay exceeded my expectations, but not enough to make up for the rest.</p>
          <p>As of right now, I cannot recommend this game unless you're willing to look past some extremely obvious and glaring optimization issues. I'm running this game on an i5-12400F and a goddamn RTX 3070 Ti. Without frame generation and DLSS turned on, this shit ran at max 40 FPS on a medium preset @ 2k resolution. With it all turned on, I could regularly stabilize at 100 FPS during most normal gameplay. During the final fights with the cloudy sky, rainy weather, and more than usual enemies, I was hitting 50-60 FPS at a good moment. It <b>really</b> took me out of it.</p>
          <p>Another thing about the ending of the game. <span id=spoiler>I hope <i>Spider-Man 3</i> doesn't do another "Anti-BBEG" suit for the final fight. It worked fine for Doc-Ock in <i>Spider-Man PS4</i> but an "Anti-Venom" suit that gives him all the positives without any of the negatives kinda destroys the entire fucking point of the addiction allegory that Venom is supposed to be. Thank God they invented Anti-Heroin that gets me high and doesn't make me sleepy and angry!</span></p>
          <p>Speaking of suits. Of the 39 suits Peter gets in the base game (I didn't get the Digital Deluxe Edition), 14 (!!!) of them were licensed from movies. That's fucking 35%! Of those 14, over HALF of them are MCU! Do we really need entirely different suit slots for the 4 different colors that Tom's suit comes in? Was there a licensing deal that they couldn't do the color schemes for those? And did we <b>REALLY</b> need both Iron Spider <i>Armor</i> (comics) AND Iron Spider <i>Suit</i> (MCU)? Same with the TWO Tobey suits! Why couldn't it be a color scheme difference for Webbed and Webbed Black? I'll admit, the Spider-Noir was a great suit, and I love seeing the animation on that while swinging through New York.</p>
          <p>I think Miles had way better suits. Sportswear, Bodega Cat, and Best There Is got very frequent use in my playthrough. His suits really fit his character a lot better than most of Peter's, which were just movie nostalgia bait. No comment on the Evolved Suit, though. I hope they move away from the movie stuff for the next game and give comic fans what they want!</p>
          <p>The story (apart from the Anti-Venom suit, which I talked about earlier) was told really well. I cried when I was supposed to, and laughed when they made me. I loved their (albeit, brief) take on <span id="spoiler">Agent Venom</span>, and I think <span id="spoiler">Harry becoming Venom</span> worked really well for the universe they've cultivated. It was really funny seeing how hard <span id="spoiler">Carnage</span> was teased knowing the DLC never happened and we're gonna have to wait a couple more years to see if anything ever <i>does</i> happen with it. I loved the post-credit scene of <span id="spoiler">Cindy Moon</span> getting introduced; the clumsiness of the tease was very reminiscent of reading comic books and them teasing a new character. <span id="spoiler">With Peter deciding to take a step back to focus on EMF, maybe this means that the next game will have Spider-Man and Silk Spider saving the city. I just hope they don't do the pheromone stuff</span>. Either way, more comic suits for <span id="spoiler">Cindy since she hasn't had her movie debut yet!</span></p>
          <p>As for Kraven, I thought he was great! I haven't read <i>Kraven's Last Hunt</i> but it immediately got downloaded on Marvel Unlimited as soon as I finished the game. I thought it was interesting that <span id="spoiler">he basically didn't care about Spider-Man until the symbiote started taking over. He completely underestimated Spider-Man's strength</span>, and I thought that was a really fun and unique take on the character. I loved seeing all the evidence of various dead villains from Spider-Man's past, and I'm excited to see new villains that never got a chance to shine in the mainstream (Black Tarantula would go so <strong>hard</strong> next game).</p>
          <p>The collectibles were just as fun in this game as in the previous ones. I liked the Spider-Bots a lot, and the final cutscene <span id="spoiler">queuing up for his time in <i>Across The Spider-Verse</i> was awesome</span>. I also loved the little side quests and FNSM missions. Felt like reading filler in between major arcs (in a very good way! Some of my favorite stories were filler!). I hope Insomniac's Wolverine and next Spider-Man game can keep this balance of well-timed, well-paced missions and side quests that feel so comic book-y.</p>
          <p>In all, as a Spider-Man fan, the game was a lot of fun and has me very excited for the future of Insomniac Marvel games. Maybe Wolverine will be in the same universe? That would be exciting. If you haven't played yet and are a big fan, I'd recommend if you can look past the optimization issues. If you're on the fence or looking to replay it, then maybe hold off until there's a good sale or it gets patched to hell.</p>

          <p>Picked up some bangers today!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Absolute Superman #4</li>
            <li>The Exorcism at 1600 Penn #3</li>
            <li>Scarlet Witch #9</li>
            <li>Scarlet Witch #9 (Mark Brooks Animated-Style Variant)</li>
            <li>The Ultimates #9</li>
            <li>The X-Men #131 (Facsimile Edition)</li><br>
          </ul>
          <p>I've already read Ultimates #9 and I loved Luke Cages story. The surprise first appearance was fun too. I'm so excited for Ultimate Wolverine later this month and to meet Kitty Pryde and Gambit. I'm also reading the X-Men: From The Ashes era, but I'm not buying it physically. I <b>love</b> Exceptional with Kitty and Uncanny. I think Calico is my favorite new character. I really loved the 2-issue arc after her coming to terms with her mutantness where she's screaming it from the top of her lungs. It reminded me a lot of how I felt when I first came out as trans to my family and I could finally be myself in front of everyone. I hope everyone gets one of those moments that makes me fall in love with them.</p>
          <p>I haven't gotten around to reading the rest yet, but I'm sure I'll love them. I haven't seen a new Scarlet Witch in the previews in a couple months yet, I really hope it didn't get cancelled quietly. Maybe she's going through some shit in another book that I'm not reading, but I love Amaranth and can't wait to see more of her! I'm excited for the next issue of New Champions for that main reason.</p>
